#### Student project for "E-Business" course.


The task was to create a (web) application that calls two APIs and uses the provided data in any way.

We decided to use the free Stock API "Alpha Vantage" (https://www.alphavantage.co/).

In this example, an API is first used to search for "symbols".
A second API is used to gain data from the selected "Symbol".
After that Chart.js is used to display various details of the "symbol".


## Technologies

This is the try of implementing a single page (web) application.
The following frameworks were used:

- Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/)
- Popper (https://popper.js.org/)
- jQuery (https://jquery.com/)
- Chart.js (https://www.chartjs.org/)

Unfortunately, there is a limitation on the (free) API:
